# Stock Market Simulator

The **Stock Market Simulator** is an innovative educational tool designed to revolutionize the way finance classes and educators teach students about stock trading and financial markets. With the aim of fostering a dynamic and interactive learning experience, this project allows multiple classrooms on a single network to create and manage their own simulated stock market environments. Teachers and administrators can easily monitor student performance, track activities, and provide hands-on learning experiences. The project offers both a server manager and a client application, enabling efficient deployment and management.

## Motivation

The Stock Market Simulator was born out of a desire to address the limitations of traditional, pen-and-paper stock market simulations used in many educational settings. The conventional approach required students and teachers to manually track stock performance at the end of each day, which proved to be tedious and monotonous. Additionally, it hindered effective learning, as it lacked a central platform for accessing essential market information and executing trades. The paper-based method also left room for manipulation and cheating.

Recognizing the need for a modern, interactive solution, we embarked on the journey to create the Stock Market Simulator. Our motivation was to offer a platform that brings real-time stock trading and financial market dynamics into the classroom, making learning engaging, practical, and enjoyable for students.
