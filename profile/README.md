# SSDP StockSim

**SSDP StockSim** is an innovative educational platform designed to revolutionize the way finance classes and educators teach students about stock trading and financial markets. With the aim of fostering a dynamic and interactive learning experience, this project allows multiple classrooms on a single network to create and manage their own simulated stock market environments. Teachers and administrators can easily monitor student performance, track activities, and provide hands-on learning experiences. The project offers both a server manager and a client application, enabling efficient deployment and management.

## Motivation

The Stock Market Simulator was born out of a desire to address the limitations of traditional, pen-and-paper stock market simulations used in many educational settings. The conventional approach required students and teachers to manually track stock performance at the end of each day, which proved to be tedious and monotonous. Additionally, it hindered effective learning, as it lacked a central platform for accessing essential market information and executing trades. The paper-based method also left room for manipulation and cheating.

Recognizing the need for a modern, interactive solution, we embarked on the journey to create the Stock Market Simulator. Our motivation was to offer a platform that brings real-time stock trading and financial market dynamics into the classroom, making learning engaging, practical, and enjoyable for students.

## **What's Next?**

The future development of our Stock Market Simulator is an exciting journey that we are looking forward to! Here are some directions we are considering:

- **1. Enhanced User Experience:** 

We plan to create a full-stack website using ReactJS, MongoDB, Express and NodeJS that would make the app more user-friendly by refining the interface and improving traffic.

- **2. AI Integration:**

We aim to integrate AI suggestions using Cohere's LLM to provide more resources for students when making financial decisions.

- **3. Advanced Analytics:**

We're exploring the addition of more in-depth analytics tools, such as technical indicators, historical price charts, and portfolio performance metrics. This can help users learn about advanced trading strategies.

- **4. Educational Content:**

We plan to create tutorials, articles, or videos within the app to educate users about stock market concepts, trading strategies, and investment principles.

These are just a few of the exciting possibilities for the future of our project. We value your feedback and look forward to collaborating with our community to make the Stock Market Simulator even better.
